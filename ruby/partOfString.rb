whatever = "My favorite Kingdom is Jerusalem"
puts whatever.slice(3, 4) # favo 

# The slice method is used to extract a substring from a string. 
# The first argument is the starting index and the second argument is the length of the substring. In this case, the substring starts at index 3 and has a length of 4 characters. The result is "favo".
